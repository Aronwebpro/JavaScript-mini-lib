## Fun lib with Vanilla JavaScrip 

## Description
This is my small Javascript library where I can grab prebuilt Front End Components like Modal, Accordion or other widget. Especially when I need just only one feature and I donâ€™t want to use the whole framework like jQuery or Bootstrap. 

I think is crazy to use such a big libraries when you need just only one feature or couple lines of code to make it work. 
 
I also included HTML and CSS so just copy/paste and that will work.
