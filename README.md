## Fun lib with Javascrip 

## Description
This is my small Javascript library when I need small part of JS code like Modal, Accordion or other widget while in the same time donâ€™t want to use the whole framework like jQuery or Bootstrap. 
I think is crazy to use such a big libraries when you need just only one feature or couple lines of code to make it work. 
I tried to make more universal code to cover more cases, but everything can be improved and changed to fit in specific situations. 
In the files also is included HTML and CSS scripts so you can just copy/paste and it will work.  

## Notes
I will update this repo continuously
